We're seeking passionate individuals with a strong technical foundation, backed by <strong>solid math and coding skills</strong>, who are interested in <strong>leading cutting-edge projects</strong> in ML. If you're enthusiastic, forward-thinking, and eager to pioneer innovations in the field, you're the perfect candidate we want to hear from.</p>

<p><strong>Application</strong>: The applications are centrally managed by the department (ECE and/or CS) at UW Madison. We invite you to follow the standard procedure outlined by these departments. However, you are welcome to send me an email with your CV, transcript as well as a brief description of your research interests. Unfortunately, given the high volume of applications we receive, it might not be feasible to respond to every email pertaining to PhD applications.</p>
