        <p> I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a> working with <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/volkan.cevher">Volkan Cevher</a>. Before that, I obtained my PhD from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/"> Imperial College London</a> working with <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.zafeiriou">Stefanos Zafeiriou</a>.  During my PhD, I had the chance to do internships in Facebook, Nvidia Research, and Preferred Networks. 

        <p> My research interests lie in statistical machine learning and computer vision, and more precisely in learning (robust) representations and generative modeling. You can find further details of my current and previous research projects in the publications page.

        <p> In my leisure time, I enjoy the following:</p>
        <ul class="align_left">
               	<li> <span class="thick">Travelling:</span>
                                    I enjoy travelling, meeting people, experiencing local beverages.</br>
                                    <!--<a href="travelling_map.html" class="fancybox fancybox.iframe" title="Grigoris' plan for travelling"> This</a>
                                     is a list of the places I plan to visit in the future.--></li>

               	<li> <span class="thick">Capturing the moment:</span>
                                    I enjoy photos; I ocassionally try to upload <a href="https://flic.kr/ps/zWeyY">some of them</a>.</br>
                                    <!--<a href="taking_photos.html" class="fancybox fancybox.iframe" title="Grigoris' collection of pictures">My effort</a> to share some of the attractive pics.</li>-->
               	<li> <span class="thick">Outdoor activities:</span>
                                    Any outdoor activity/sport sounds exciting to me. In fact, Switzerland offers a great chance for winter sports and incredible hikes.</li>
