        <div>
        <p> I am conducting research in Imperial College London. My research interests lie in statistical machine learning and computer vision, and more precisely in learning (robust) representations with applications in the domain of faces. You can find further details of my current and previous research projects in the publications page.

        <p> In my leisure time, I enjoy the following:</p>
        <ul class="align_left">
               	<li> <span class="thick">Travelling:</span>
                                    I enjoy travelling, meeting people, experiencing local beverages.</br>
                                    <!--<a href="travelling_map.html" class="fancybox fancybox.iframe" title="Grigoris' plan for travelling"> This</a>
                                     is a list of the places I plan to visit in the future.--></li>

               	<li> <span class="thick">Capturing the moment:</span>
                                    I love capturing the moment with a photo or video.</br>
                                    <a href="taking_photos.html" class="fancybox fancybox.iframe" title="Grigoris' collection of pictures">My effort</a> to share some of the attractive pics.</li>
               	<li> <span class="thick">Outdoor activities:</span>
                                    Any outdoor activity/sport sounds exciting; I love diverse sports, e.g. bouldering, football.</li>
        </ul>
       </div>
