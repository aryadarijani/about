As part of our latest research work, we have collected and processed one large database, coined 2MF^2. Our dataset includes over 19 million frames of human faces (over 11 thousand videos in total). 

Each clip is cropped from a longer video; each clip consists of 500-4,000 frames. Along with each frame, we provide an (automatically obtained) sparse shape of the face (annotated with the popular 68 markup). 

A video with indicative frames from several thousand clips is visualized below:

The dataset is provided *strictly for academic use*. That is, any type of commercial applications are not allowed; please refer to Youtube license for further details. 

To obtain access to the database, please follow the instructions mailed back from our gmail account: 2mf2.db[at].


The dataset is described in details in the following publication:
