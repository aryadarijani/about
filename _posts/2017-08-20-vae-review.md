Instead of creating another tutorial about Variational Autoencoders (VAE), I will share my experience on the parts that introduced me to the topic. 

VAE are a type of neural network (function approximators) that model the low-dimensional distribution of the data and then can sample from this distribution to generate synthetic data.
