<p>The semester project requires few tools that should be mostly familiar to you through your previous project in computing and ML. Most of the tutorials below are basic introductions; they will probably not cover everything you need, but they should give you an idea. </p>

<ul>

  <li> <strong style="color:blue">Git tutorial</strong>: Git is a core part of the code you will write. Git enables easy tracking of changes and is a powerful ally for avoiding unwanted changes. The recommended plan is to have a private repository that will be updated on a weekly basis. 
    <ul>
      <li> If you haven’t heard of git, there are incredible tutorials on the internet. Please follow this <a href="https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">basic tutorial</a>.  Please do not skim through it, but rather complete it. You can choose any repository you like for the parts that require a link from a repo. Even better, you can create a private repo that you will use for the project and complete the tutorials based on this private repo. </li>
          <li> After you complete the tutorial please create a private github repository; if you did that in the previous step, that’s awesome. </li>
      </ul>
</li>
  <li> <strong style="color:blue">Tmux tutorial</strong>: Tmux is a very useful tool that you can use in a remote server (if you are connected to one). The idea is that this tmux session in the remote server will remain open even after you close your ssh connection. 
      <ul>
          <li> Please go ahead and study the following <a href="https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/">tutorial</a>.  </li>
          <li> Also, if you want to do more splitting of windows or use fancy formatting options, you can find details <a href="https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/">here</a>. This is optional, since even basic tmux can do the job.  </li>
       </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <strong style="color:blue">Debugging python scripts</strong>: Mistakes are (almost) unavoidable when writing (python) code, hence one of the crucial components is how to learn to resolve them quickly. 
        <ul>
          <li> Even though there is not a unique way to debug, there are a couple of recommended practices that can be useful for faster debugging. This is an absolutely <a href="https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/">essential tutorial</a>. The command ‘pdb.set_trace()’ can be used when issues with your code are faced. </li>
          <li> Complementary ways to debug can be found, for instance using the logging/printing and the assert as <a href="https://hub.packtpub.com/learn-how-to-debug-in-python-tutorial/">this tutorial</a> stresses out.</li>
          <li> In the beginning you might also simply google your error, it is highly likely that for simple errors the first answer of google will provide a fix. However, the goal is to rely increasingly on your skills and pdb to find and fix the errors fast. </li>
       </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <strong style="color:blue">LaTex tutorial</strong>: LaTex is a tool required for the report and the outcomes of this project. 
        <ul>
          <li> If you have not used LaTex before, I recommend spending some time getting accustomed to it. Even if you have written in Latex before, please do check out these tutorials. </li>
          <li> There are few cloud-based LaTeX editors; I recommend Overleaf; when you complete the tutorials below, you can open a new project on Overleaf and try the commands they share yourself. </li>
          <li> A basic tutorial for LaTex is <a href="https://latex-tutorial.com/quick-start/">this</a>.  Please complete it by copying their commands in a new project in overleaf. </li>
          <li> A complimentary tutorial that includes more commands is <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes">this</a>.</li>
  		</ul>
  </li>
  <li> <strong style="color:blue">PyTorch tutorial</strong>: PyTorch is a machine learning framework that you most probably need for the project. 
        <ul>
          <li> If you have not used PyTorch before, please go ahead and complete the following <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html">basic tutorial</a>. 
          <li> If you have used PyTorch before for building your own model, I recommend checking the visualization tools at your disposal in PyTorch, e.g. through <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_tutorial.html">Tensorboard</a>. Most of those visualizations can be achieved outside of tensorboard, but tensorboard provides an easy interface to inspect the model during training. 
          <li> A basic (but useful) cheatsheet for your project is <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/ptcheat.html ">this</a>.
  </li>
  
</ul>

If you face any issues completing those tutorials, please reach out. We can discuss them in the regular meeting hours.
